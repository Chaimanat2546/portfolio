## Research Paper Analysis

**Paper:** Web Application Development of Secondary Education Carbon Footprint Monitoring System

**Authors:** Jeanne D'Arc Amara Hanieka, Kridanto Surendro (Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia)

**Conference:** 2024 11th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concept, Theory and Application (ICAICTA)

**DOI:** 10.1109/ICAICTA63815.2024.10763248

### Key Findings

**Research Problem:**
- Widespread technology integration in secondary schools lacks environmental impact awareness
- No existing system specifically monitors carbon emissions from educational technology in secondary education
- Schools often procure equipment without considering carbon footprint

**Proposed Solution:**
- Web-based application for monitoring and optimizing carbon footprint in secondary education
- Uses existing school data (schedules, inventory, energy consumption) to calculate and predict emissions
- Includes optimization function to guide sustainable procurement decisions

**Technical Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Material UI + Glide Data Grid
- Backend: Python Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Language: Indonesian

**Core Features:**
1. **Emission Monitoring:** Track CO2 emissions at school and room levels
2. **Data Management:** Upload/edit room data, equipment data, class schedules
3. **Prediction:** Forecast future carbon emissions
4. **Purchase Optimization:** Mathematical optimization model to decide which equipment to purchase within budget and emission constraints

**Optimization Model:**
```
Objective: Minimize -∑ log(1 + priorityᵢ) × xᵢ
Subject to:
  - Total cost ≤ Max Budget
  - Total emissions ≤ Max Emissions
  - xᵢ ∈ {0,1} (binary decision variable)
```

**Carbon Calculation:**
```
E_electricity = E_f × P × t
Where:
  - E_f = 0.7848 kg CO2e/kWh (Indonesia grid emission factor, 2022)
  - P = Power consumption (Watt)
  - t = Usage time (hours)
```

**Test Case:**
- Tested with "X School" (junior high school in Central Jakarta)
- Data sources: Room usage schedules (PDF), class data (spreadsheet), inventory (PDF)

**Result Example:**
```
Status: Infeasible
Purchase_('Class103', 'Komputer') = 1.0
Purchase_('Class103', 'Smartboard') = 3.0
```
- System shows status when constraints cannot be fully met
- Provides alternative recommendations for procurement

**Recommendations for Future Work:**
- Conduct formal user requirement gathering
- Implement user testing with actual school administrators

### Summary
This research addresses the gap in environmental awareness regarding educational technology by providing a data-driven tool for secondary schools to monitor and reduce their carbon footprint through optimized procurement decisions.

### Tools Used
- `pdftotext` for PDF text extraction
